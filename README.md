This project will be using the Boston Housing Dataset to predict the value of housing prices.  

This project has been split into three tasks for us to tackle:
1) Implement a gradient boosted tree model with the sklearn library.
2) Implement a gradient boosted tree model from scatch using only a select few libraries.
3) Conduct exploratory data analysis and propose the setting and variables that perform best for prediction house prices.

The files contained within this project are as follows:
   - Final_Presentation.ipynb: Jupytr Notebook containing all tasks and custom functions and classes.
   - jpm_gradient_boosted_tree_classes.py: Custom classes for our model: DecisionTree and GradientBoostAll. The classes are cleaned and packages.
   - jpm_functions.py: Custom functions: outlier_removal, my_train_test_split, my_mse, my_rmse, my_mae, my_r2, and my_performance.
   - eda.ipynb: File containing our work for the exploratory data analysis
   - house.csv: The Boston Housing dataset
   - boosted_grad.ipyn: File containing our work for the gradient boosted class.
